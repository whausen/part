Adhocracy
=========


About
-----

Adhocracy is a web based software tool which facilitates cooperative policy
drafting, proposal discussion and decisions in distributed groups.

It is primarily developed by the `Liquid Democracy e.V. <http://liqd.de>`_ as a
platform to implement Liquid Democracy concepts, as well as to provide a simple
and working general purpose online participation platform.


Technology
----------

Adhocracy is mostly written in Python 2. It's built on top of many free
software projects, such as the Pylons web framework, the Solr search platform,
Memcached, RabbitMQ, many Python libraries and more.


Installing
----------

Adhocracy is known to run on current Linux systems, such as Debian Squeeze. It
might run on FreeBSD or OS X, but this hasn't been tested recently.

Installation is usually done through buildout or through an installer script
for Debian based systems. In either case, read `INSTALLATION.md
<INSTALLATION.md>`_.


Development
-----------

Adhocracy is openly developed as free software and distributed for the common
good under the `AGPLv3 license <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html>`_.

Source code hosting, bug tracking and planned feature discussion is done `on
GitHub <https://github.com/liqd/adhocracy>`_.

Communication also takes place on the `adhocracy-dev mailing list
<http://lists.liqd.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/adhocracy-dev>`_.

Documentation is included in the source code and can be read online `on
readthedocs <http://adhocracy.readthedocs.org>`_.

We're very open for contributions, please drop us a note on the mailing list or
create a pull request on GitHub.
