adhocracy Changelog
===================

1.2beta2dev
-----------
- Replace RabbitMQ/amqp with redis/rq. This means that you have to
  provide a working redis instance if you want to use asyncronous
  jobs (highly recommended in production).
  The background process that processes the jobs is renamed from
  'background' to 'worker'. You can call it with
  `bin/paster --plugin=adhocracy worker -c etc/adhocracy.ini`

  Configuration changes:

  * dropped: adhocracy.amqp.* settings are not required anymore.
  * new: adhocracy.redis.host: An IP address redis can bind to 
    (not a hostname!)
  * new: adhocracy.redis.port: The port redis will open
  * new: adhocracy.redis.queue: The queue name

- Added facet search to the instance listing. The listing is based on solr now, 
  please reindex. [joka]

- Instances can have badges now. To create instance badges use the 
  site-administration -> badges form. To assign badges use the 
  instance listing. [joka]]

- New config option "adhocracy.registration.email.blacklist" that
  accepts a whitspace seperated list of email address and
  blocks registrations with those. Dots will be stripped before
  the test (to catch gmail addresses where dots are ignored by gmail).
  [csenger]

- New config option "adhocracy.listings.instance.sorting" that makes
  the sort options for the instance listing configurable. This
  possible values are: OLDEST, NEWEST, ACTIVITY and ALPHA. [csenger]

- Permission change: When we test the 'norm.create' permission 
  (permission to create Norms/Topics/Themen we do no longer
  restrict it to users who also have 'instance.admin'. The main
  permission we check now is 'page.create'.

  Please check the permission 'page.create' in your permission 
  settings (<base_url>/admin -> Permissions). [csenger]
- Give the users the option to permanently activate the twitter, 
  facebook or google+ buttons. Save the setting in a wildcard 
  subdomain cookie so it is valid across all instances.

  This requires a updated js.socialshareprivacy to work with
  our auth cookie. [csenger]
- Add the possibility to overwrite templates in <adhocracy.site>/templates 
  directory (like it's possible for static resources and static pages already.
  New templates there need a server restart to be picked up.
  [csenger]
- Deliver (almost) all resources with fanstatic. [csenger] 
- Delgateables can have category badgets. [joka]
- Instances can have badgets, they are only valid inside that instance. [joka]
- Added option to set the smtp port. [joka]
